### Prospects need help in selecting the right solution for their goals. They have too much information and too many options

According to a research from April Dunford, 50% of sales are lost not to competitors but to **no action** from the prospect due to info orverload - _"not knowing what to do, they do nothing"_.

At the same time according to Gartner, 75% of small and medium businesses owners prefer to buy with no involvement of a salesperson.

In a world of infinite information, companies need deep and informed connections with their clients to help them understand what solution would help them best reach their goals / solve their problems.

So, sales acceleration and revenue intelligence software is exploding. Most efficient companies understand that they need very clear messages to guide their clients towards a purchase and leverage the power of tools like Clay, Apollo, Gong, or even Sales Navigator.

### My job is to make sure companies succeed at conveying their Unique Value Propostion to the right prospects so that it's easier for them to ... buy!

I write sales copy for web sales pages and presentations that will consistently turn more leads into clients, I support companies as they build processes that will allow sales, product marketing and customer support to be better connected, and I create compelling product strategies focused on customers needs.

Companies that worked with me in the past often achieved a significant boost in either revenue or cash generation. If you believe you can benefit from working with me, reach out now.
