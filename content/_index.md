### Supporting entrepreneurs and marketing managers build sales strategies and communications

It's a demand driven world. Options for buyers are virtually endless. This often creates confusion and eventually inaction in buyers.

According to a research from April Dunford, 50% of sales are lost not to competitors but to **no action** from the buyer due to info orverload - _"not knowing what to do, they do nothing"_.

At the same time the demand driven world is also flooded with information. Every buyer can learn any topic if they want to.
According to Gartner, 75% of small and medium businesses owners prefer to buy with no involvement of a salesperson.

In a world of infinite information, companies need deep and informed connections with their clients to help them understand what solution would help them best reach their goals / solve their problems.

This is also an opportunity for companies that are able to help buyers ... buy! Helping chosing a solution is becoming an effective sales strategy.

### My job is to make sure companies succeed at conveying their Unique Value Propostion to the right prospects so that it's easier for them to ... buy!

I help with sales documentation, sales process, and software automation setup.

Sales copy for web sales pages and presentations that will consistently turn more leads into clients. Companies will be able to build a sales engine by creating 3 pillars:

- Processes
- Product Content
- Automation

My job is to build a system that allows managers to recognize buyers personas, that sends the right messages at each stage of the purchasing process, and that leverages the automation capabilities of modern sales enablment software.
