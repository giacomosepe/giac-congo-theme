# The role of publishing in today's economy

## Where are we now

During the industrial revolution, most companies' main challenge was to get production right and then communicate how good the output was. Shareholders of these companies would raise capital, get financing from banks and invest in bid tangible assets such machineries, lgoistics, buildings. Most of these of machineries eventually became bankable and companies could leverage both mapower working at their factories and the capital as banks would finance them.

In the market of the industrial revolution the difficult part was the production, the organization of the factory, the distribution.
Demand for products had an unsteadty growth for more or less the whole XX century and companies could easily sell their production, until at some point (notably the 80s) they had to make heavy use of advertising to beat competition and sell more of their products.

## Enter globalization, computers, and the internet.

The all equation of the 1900 started to crack at the end of the century and is now virtually flipped.
Companies can produce most of the goods that the market wants with no particular difficulty. In the XXi century _"production is easy"_.

Companies can produce almost any product anywhere in the world and ship finished products, components or parts anywhere at a fraction of the cost of just a few decades ago.  
Geographical specialization and information circulation has allowed for high quality products to be manufactured in many countries.

Production is not a problem anymore. Companies can't just produce and advertise + sell anymore. Companies are more and more forced to produce their own Demand.
Same pattern is seen in the service business, where production can also be decentralized with the cost of international communication collapsing to close to zero. Customer service teams or specialists can be located in any low labor cost country and serve any Western world country as if they were in the same city as the customer.

Production of services is easy. And Cheap.

## Demand is the challenge

Since production is so easy, the number of producers skyrocketed, and What used to be easy, demand, is now the most difficult part. Today the generation of demand is the biggest challenge for most companies.

Customers have access to so much information that companies struggle to emerge from the noise. Social Media, television, web advertising are trying to get their companies noticed. One of the main indicators for any business operator is the Cost of Acquisition of Customers.
