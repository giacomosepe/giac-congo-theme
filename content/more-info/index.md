# I develop wonderful businesses

### For over a decade I have been partnering with business owners and investors to build a product-led, sustainable, and disruptive businesses

![Digital business](Effortless250x.png)

I have learned how to achieve growth in the hardest possible way. When I started working as a manager I faced all kinds of challenges:

- relationships with CEOs or shareholders
- relationships with colleagues
- relationship with clients
- total lack of data to use to make decisions
- time pressure to deliver products before they are outdated, or before its too late for clients to buy in
- aks the right price

I also realized that when you start to be successful the job becomes exciting, new opportunites show up, people are happy, and everything seems to work as easy as a Sunday night dinner with friends.

Growing businesses is rewarding. Making money is nice. It builds confidence and removes stress.

So much so, that I started wondering if there was a way to streamline growth success and make it predictable. Or at least overcome complete unpredictability and random results. Turns out that there are some behaviours and strategies that can help us in turning business growth into a more predictable (ad)venture.

So how can we turn an adventure seemingly upredictable by nature into a predictable venture? Is it really likley, or even possible, to be able to predict growth and eliminate the stress while increasing revenue and headcount?

I bought in the idea that the media era in which we live allow us to do it with a good approximation. My job is to make sure companies that work with me pursue this strategy successfully.

## Growing a company, especially a service company, can be brutal

### Kick off, great start. Life is great!

You have started the company and you are between â‚¬2 and â‚¬5 mln of annual revenue.
Or you have entered your family business to support operations and sales and your company is between â‚¬10 and â‚¬20 mln.

Things looking good as clients grow and revenue increases.

Then complexity grows. The market changes. You need to hire more people. Select a new software.

Costs pile up.

The pressure on sales increases as it needs to serve a higher cost base. If there is debt it also needs to pay off interests.

And with the core offering the revenue can only grow this much. It gets difficult to find more and bigger clients. It is difficult to change category. The system is built so that small and medium entrepreneur have a very tough time in scaling above the â‚¬10 mln revenue threshold, and even more difficult the â‚¬20mln.

It is a this point that companies either fail or make a jump ahead. This is a very delicate phase.

### What are your options now?

There are really two big alternatives:

- Double down and hire more (sales?) people, hire an IT consultant to install Salesforce ("we are big now, we need what big companies use"), build automation processes and review the GTM strategy.
- Find an investor (or raise another round) who can help supporting the growing cost and who brings some industry expertise

Or at least this was the case so far. This is the old way. It has always been like this. More or less. Especially for service companies.

What's wrong with these two options?

One thing that is certainly a problem is that as complexity of organizations grows so do the costs. You need more people, and managers to manage them. You need a structure and an operations manager to set it up, optimize it and make it work. You need a sales force, software, goals setting, MBOs. As new people arrive you need to formalize company culture. And you need to keep the employees happy, they become something like customers. They are the voice of the company.

Another problem is that as you bring consultants in, you need managers who understand what they are doing. You also need to train people to use the new systems.

The second option, to bring in new investors, will force you to increase sales, you will have to deliver on business plan. You might have to hire people fast, to comply to the plan.

Your sales team will be under greater pressure. You will not have fun unless things go really really well.

**THEREFORE**

I argue there is another option.

_"The third way"_.

It consists of building multiple revenue streams that complement the core business. But are not correlated to it.

## Build multiple streams

### Three categories of additional revenue streams

Any company today has the opportunity to build an ecosystem of assets that generate cash, in other words multiple revenue streams.
I have identified three main categories of revenue streams that can, or should, be added to the business

- Education services that train people on topics for which your company is respected
- Media assets that generate awareness of your services / products and that increase your authority to generate leads
- Online operations that convert leads into clients of different products through a good product positioning and relevant copywriting, sales funnel, outstanding customer service, and well executed operations automation

Delivering on all these categories will guarantess exponential growth, for revenue and margins. Making entrepreneurs and investors life easier. Removing pressure from the sales team and planning for a long time.

## I bring experiences in sales, analysis, automation software, and copywriting

Working as a manager for private equity and family offices or business owners and founders, I developed a product-led business growth strategy framework that helps shareholders increase share value.
I rely on 25 years of experience with growing responsibilities in business development, capital raising, and business writing in English and Italian.

I have developed an expertise to build multiple revenue streams in the forms of products alongside core busiensses

The better the words the better the revenue. A possible playbook for entrepreneurs:
1 - get customer insights though the right words
2 - state the purpose with a well crafted tagline
3 - curate the copy of the website with clear messages and actions
4 - use a funnel to instill curiosity and tunr it into desire. And eventually into fandom!

Business owners who learn to adopt the right framework can repeat the process over and over for different products.

They can turn their companies into portfolios of products and media, or intangible assets, that will scale and generate cash indefinitely.

Most of the times business growth can be based on a simple repeatable process yet not an easy one.

It ultimately comes down to finding the right words. The better the words the better the revenue.
I have been applying this media transformation strategy at companies in the retail, technology and entertainment industries and itâ€™s been professionally fulfilling for me as well as economically rewarding for the companies I worked with in the past.
