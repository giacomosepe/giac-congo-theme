Giacomo Sepe is a manager-turned entrepreneur in 2022, with 15 years of experience at large financial institutions and with some of Italy's and Switzerland's best-known private entrepreneurs.

Believing that modern companies can, and probably in the future will have to, invest more in media and digital assets to create revenue, value, and possibly higher margins, Mr Sepe has begun to develop a shortlist of services and products to support small and medium-sized business entrepreneurs.

The long term vision of the project is centered on creating tools to enable entrepreneurs to:

- Improve their connection with their customer base through understanding their needs and establishing a reputation as an authority in the industry;
- Make and sell digital and media products that are useful to the existing customer base, infinitely replicable, and have profitability potential

The first product, which will be aimed specifically at entrepreneurs who want to create or improve their personal brand, is in the making.

Currently based in Milan, Giacomo Sepe was born in Naples and trained in the United States, where he earned an MBA from Columbia University. He also worked for Merrill Lynch in London, where he was responsible for sales and support of private equity products, for Hines Real Estate and UBS Real Estate in Milan, where he was investment manager, for EQValue Private Equity in Rome, where he was investment manager, and finally for three international family offices where he was venture partner in charge of operations of some investees. The last assignment completed in 2021 was the management and sale of a small company in Milan, Cotolicious.

Mr. Sepe is also fluent in Italian, Spanish, and French.
