# I develop wonderful businesses

## For the past 10 years I have been partnering with business owners and investors

The better the words the better the revenue. A possible playbook for entrepreneurs:
1 - get customer insights though the right words
2 - state the purpose with a well crafted tagline
3 - curate the copy of the website with clear messages and actions
4 - use a funnel to instill curiosity and tunr it into desire. And eventually into fandom!

Business owners who learn to adopt the right framework can repeat the process over and over for different products.

They can turn their companies into portfolios of products and media, or intangible assets, that will scale and generate cash indefinitely.

Most of the times business growth can be based on a simple repeatable process yet not an easy one.

It ultimately comes down to finding the right words. The better the words the better the revenue.

A possible playbook for entrepreneurs:
1 - get customer insights: finding the right words to get reliable data from the customers
2 - state the purpose, and a tagline: finding 10-20 words the drive everything we do
3 - publish a good website with words that show we understand the customer and inspire trust
4 - build a sales process with messages that turn indifference into curiosity and then into desire. And eventually into fanatism!

Business owners who learn to adopt the right framework can repeat the process over and over for different products and turn their companies into portfolios of products and media, or intangible assets, that will scale and generate cash indefinitely.
