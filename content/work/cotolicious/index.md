_2019 - 2021 Milan:_
In 2018 Cotolicious, a food retail chain in Milano, had reached a revenue plateau and was struggling to grow further, they had 4 physical stores and were selling online via delivery companies that would take almost 35% of the invoices as commission.

## Challenge

The company had to find a way to increase both revenue and margins as delivery companies were sucking away all their profits.

## Insight

Cotolicious was an iconic product, typical fried milanese food, that had a solid base of loyal fans. Yet the margins were low and since it only had fried food even loyal customers only went to its restaurants once a month on average.

## Solution

We decided to create an online catering offer so that clients were incentivized to order from Cotolicious when they had small gatherings or parties. In addition Cotolicious added a rotational menu based on NON-fried typical milanese food so that customers who would not eat fried food often could shop at the restaurants too
