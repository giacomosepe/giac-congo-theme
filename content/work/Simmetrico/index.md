Simmetrico is a communication and events agency with strong roots in pop culture and history.
In 2015 the company delivered a multi year contract that absorbed most of its capacity and that forced it to hire people and grow their cost base.
As the deadline approached they had wanted to find ways to sustain the increased production capability and cost base.

## Challenge

Simmetrico needed to identify new business lines that could help the company stay afloat, generate more revenue, and expand internationally

## Insight

Simmetrico was spending a lot of money on bid processes for regular campaigns. But employee base had incredible skills of storytelling beyond commercial evnets and campaigns.

## Solution

We came up with the launch of Simmetrico Cultura, a subsidiary that develops cultural exhibition concepts of historical sites and personalities and that sells them to institutions around the world. Simmetrico Cultura allowed Simmetrico to productize its competences and generate additional revenue to its core business in a scalable and repeatable way.
