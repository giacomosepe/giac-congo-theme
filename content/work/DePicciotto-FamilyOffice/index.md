De Picciotto is a Swiss family with several assets in Southern Italy, as the investor has acquired over several years many real estate assets in the Puglia region, including masserias, hotels, and other entertainment facilities such as a beach club, a cinema, and an events location.

## Challenge

In 2020/21 the company had to decide how to face the liquidity crunch followed the lockdown measures introduced by the European governments limiting movement and thus tourism.

## Insight

The company had a very strong reputation for quality and high end services and had also developed a format that HNW clients had appreciated while staying at the properties.

## Solution

We decided to create a brand, Pettolecchia, that would function as HQ and as guarantee of quality and service for all the properties in Puglia and Sicily. This virtually created a brand overnight and clients had one webpage, one phone number and one customer service to contact when they wanted to book.
