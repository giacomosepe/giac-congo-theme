{{<lead>}} Business is changing fast. We live in a demand dominated world. Building products, physical and digital, became much easier, and therefore almost every market is flooded with options.

Prospects have access to every possible information. Before they buy anything, they can gather enough information to become an expert.

Very recently, I experienced how much this is a demand driven world. I need a corkscrew... I wanted to buy a simple, no brainer corkscrew for opening wine bottles. Easy, I thought.

As soon as I searched on Amazon, hundreds of options came out with prices from €3 to €100. What's the difference?? I could have bought the cheapest, of course. Or the most expensvie. No, not me. I went through the reviews. I searched Google. Reddit. And Quora! I was even more confused: _"you need the two steps"_, "_the steel_", "_the weight_". this is too much to learn. I don't want to become an expert, but it felt unavoidable!

I ended up spending a whole evening reading and comparing. I was surprised by myself as I went on comparing my options despite having close to no interest in the topic. I was hooked in information overload. **Turns out 70% of business services prospects put a lot of time in researching before they buy, without talking to a sales person**.

At the end of a boring evening, I hit BUY, confidently considering myself an expert on the topic. And I felt so proud when my brand new, sommelier quality, corkscrew was dropped on my door!

### Companies have to play a new game

Companies have to react to this ever changing world and need to focus on developing relationships with their audience to win business. They must earn trust and imagination. It's not by chance that the value premium of a strong brand has exploded.

I help companies set up processes and create effective messaging to help buyers navigate the options and eventually purchasing from them.

I help them tap into the right markets through customer discovery, product positioning strategy and clear, compelling, specific, data-based copywriting.

This is the winning sales strategy of the 2020s, and all companies should at least listen.
