Very recently, I experienced just that!.. with a screwdriver! I wanted to buy a simple, no brainer screwdriver for opening wine bottles. Easy, I thought.

As soon as I searched on Amazon, hundreds of options came out with prices from €3 to €100. Whats the difference?? I could have bought the cheapest, of course. Or the most expensvie. No, not me. Read the reviews. Searched google. Reddit. And Quora! Ever more confused: _"you need the two steps"_, "_the steel_", "_the weight_". WoW! I ended up spending a whole evening reading and comparing. Crazy. I was surprised by self as I went on comparing my options. I never meant to become the world's expert of screwdrivers, but I couldn't help it. **Turns out 70% of business services prospects put a lot of time in researching before they buy, without talking to a sales person**. And, so, I felt so proud when my brand new, sommelier quality, screwdriver was dropped on my door!

### Companies have to play a new game

Companies have to react to this ever changing world and need to focus on developing relationships with their audience to win business. They must earn trust and imagination. It's not by chance that the value premium of a strong brand has exploded.

And so has influencer marketing, which allows companies to tap into exsiting niche communities. Actually into existing "_trust_".

They need to understand the needs and wants of the people (not personas!) in the niche they want to sell to, and they have to create a specific offer for it. And then, they need to communicate very clearly, why they are best option, or even better **for who they are the best option**.

I help companies identify opporunties and boost revenue. I help them tap into the right markets through customer discovery, product positioning strategy and clear, compelling, specific, data-based copywriting.

This is the winning strategy of the 2020s, and all companies should at least listen.
