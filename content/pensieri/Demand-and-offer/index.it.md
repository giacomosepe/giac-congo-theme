# The role of publishing in today's economy

## Where are we now

During the industrial revolution, most companies' main challenge was to get production right and then communicate how good the output was. Shareholders of these companies would raise capital, get financing from banks and invest in bid tangible assets such machineries, lgoistics, buildings. Most of these of machineries eventually became bankable and companies could leverage both mapower working at their factories and the capital as banks would finance them.

In the market of the industrial revolution the difficult part was the production, the organization of the factory, the distribution.
Demand for products had an unsteadty growth for more or less the whole XX century and companies could easily sell their production, until at some point (notably the 80s) they had to make heavy use of advertising to beat competition and sell more of their products.

## Enter globalization, computers, and the internet.

The all equation of the 1900 started to crack at the end of the century and is now virtually flipped.
Companies can produce most of the goods that the market wants with no particular difficulty. In the XXi century _"production is easy"_.

Companies can produce almost any product anywhere in the world and ship finished products, components or parts anywhere at a fraction of the cost of just a few decades ago.  
Geographical specialization and information circulation has allowed for high quality products to be manufactured in many countries.

Production is not a problem anymore. Companies can't just produce and advertise + sell anymore. Companies are more and more forced to produce their own Demand.
Same pattern is seen in the service business, where production can also be decentralized with the cost of international communication collapsing to close to zero. Customer service teams or specialists can be located in any low labor cost country and serve any Western world country as if they were in the same city as the customer.

Production of services is easy. And Cheap.

## Demand is the challenge

Since production is so easy, the number of producers skyrocketed, and What used to be easy, demand, is now the most difficult part: today the generation of demand is the biggest challenge for most companies. Emerging from the noise, get customers to trust them and worse buy from them is challenging.

Customers have access to so much information that companies struggle to emerge from the noise. Social Media, television, web advertising are trying to get their companies noticed. One of the main indicators for any business operator is the Cost of Acquisition of Customers.

So in the late 2010s some companies, mainly tech, started to publish and distribute content it for free to their users. It got labelled Content Marketing.

Content marketing had a significant growth over the subsequent years into the 2020s.
The goal of content marketing is to get customers to know better and eventually trust the companies they buy from. This trust building process has been analyzed and quantified. A Google research estimated that it takes an average of 11 interactions over 4 different media channels to get someone to trust a company.

## To generate demand companies have to become publishers or media companies

Producing and publishing content is becoming mandatory for most companies both in the services and manufacturing industries, and both B2B and B2C. Producing content is a key competition strategy.
Publishing started as a social media strategy, and many companies took advantage of social networks, video platforms (talking to you, YouTube!) and newsletters to build their content.

In the 2020s simple social media strategy is not enough anymore. Publishing high quality content on social media is so easy, accessible and cheap that the noise became a deep dense layer of fog. Companies have to use a mix of channels for their content.

More advanced companies started creating communities and most importangly started personalizing content down to the level of the single recipient.

This is where we are now. AI allows to send personalized communication at scale. Companies that fail to embrace this trend will miss out on the challenging task of demand generation.

In an unforseen twist of facts, publishing as an industry mgiht have unexpected resurgence, if it learns how to leverage the new technologies that are coming to the marketin in the mid 20s: AI and Distributed Ownerships of digital assets based on blockchain.

Interesting and exciting times are ahead of us.
