A small collection of thoughts and ideas centered on writing, business and on how business and publishing might converge.
Since I constantly develop my career these ideas are the result of my learning along the way on the topics that mostly interest me, business and writing. Some will be lessons I learned, often the hard way, some will be concepts I develop, and some will discoveries I make about these two worlds, hoping that they are usefull to anyone reading.
