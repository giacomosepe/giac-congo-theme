### _...and make some revenue_

I have become fully hands on, so no strategies, plans, or powerpoints. Just real operational activities that impact revenue.

### 1) Become client of one of the businesses I am part of and purchase a service that will boosts your revenue

You send me your assets, internet sites, emails copy, and I will provide my point of view with plenty of actianable advice for you to improve, if it needs it.
I will review your material and within a week I will send you a video with my recorded comments and document with potential improvements in the copy and in the organization. Including software you can use to become more efficient. This is a paid service with a fixed fee.

- **[PageCraft](https://pagecraft.it):** Have your book published or written for you

- **[Lemon Perks](https://pagecraft.it):** Build sales media assets, copy and funnels

- **[BubiBots](https://pagecraft.it):** Finance your AI and software investments

**ALL:** See all projects and ideas [here](https://projects.giacomosepe.com)

### 2) Joint venture: partner with me to build one or more products that generate additional revenue streams

You have an idea, or a project, and you need a partner to develop it. We can have a video discussion on the project. You will have to share me all the information you deem useful and I will respond within a week if my team and I can be helpful to your project. I will analyze the market, make a plan (for myself!) with goals and milestones (also for you!), set up the marketing funnel and the copy, and I will create a roadmap and manage the team until results are in.

### 3) Venture Capital: invest in one of my businesses, when they are open for investments

You have a business that you want to launch or relaunch. You can have me help you set it up as a manager for specific period of time. I will deliver market insights, busienss goals, software selection, copy, sales funnel, team management and product management.
